## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the dashboard layout for an e-commerce website.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing the initial styles for the dashboard.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing setup instructions and project context.

## Getting Started

Once you have set up the project, you can start practicing advanced CSS techniques by completing the following tasks:

### Task 1: Using Variables

Enhance the styling of the product items on the dashboard by utilizing CSS variables. Define variables for colors, font sizes, and other common styles to maintain consistency and facilitate easier customization.

### Task 2: Nesting Styles

Refactor the CSS code to leverage nesting for better organization and readability. Use nesting to target nested elements within the HTML structure and apply styles more efficiently.

### Task 3: Modularizing Styles with Imports

Break down the CSS code into modular files based on different components or sections of the dashboard. Use `@import` to import these modular CSS files into the main stylesheet, keeping the codebase organized and manageable.
